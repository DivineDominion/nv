MultiMarkdown bundled in
========================

This repository features a standard MultiMarkdown package according to my own fork at <http://github.com/DivineDominion/MultiMarkdown>.

You will not be able to make any customizations to MultiMarkdown now.  There is no way to change settings yet, but it is coming as soon as possible!

Use custom MultiMarkdown setup
==============================

Simply use an older version.  "Older" means I didn't include MultiMarkdown back then, but there really is no other difference in functionality!

Download the **binary** from <http://github.com/DivineDominion/nv/downloads>:

*	_bundled_ means, you'll have a fixed MultiMarkdown setup included in
	Notational Velocity, whereas
*	the other binary download assumes MultiMarkdown in 
	`~/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown/`.
